        Knucklebones is a two player dice rolling game and its origin appears to
        be a minigame created for the 2022 video game "Cult of the Lamb".
        Players take turns rolling a die, then placing that die on their board
        to be scored. Multiple similar dice in the same column will drastically
        increase the score of that column. However, when a die is placed in a
        column, if your opponent currently has any dice of the SAME value in the
        SAME column on their board, those dice are removed from the board. This
        creates a game with an interesting risk/reward mechanic that increases
        the amount of strategy involved in winning.
